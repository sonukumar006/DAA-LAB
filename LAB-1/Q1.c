/*
 Comparing exponents/growth classes
 (I verified this with the C program below),
 the increasing order of growth is:

1/𝑛<log 𝑛<12 sqrt(𝑛)  < 50𝑛^0.5<𝑛^0.51<𝑛log𝑛<𝑛^2−324<100𝑛^2+6𝑛 < 2𝑛^3 < 𝑛^log𝑛  < 3^𝑛  <  (2^32)*𝑛
*/

 /*A function with a technically smaller growth rate can still be
 larger in absolute value for a long stretch of small-to-moderately-large n.
 For example n^0.51 vs 50·n^0.5, the crossover happens at
n = 50^100 ≈ 1.27 × 10^170. Before that point, 50·n^0.5 is numerically larger
 This is a good illustration of what "sufficiently large n"
really means in Big-O: it's a mathematical guarantee about
the eventual trend (the 0.01 extra exponent will always win in the end,
no matter how big the constant 50 is),
but "eventually" can be a genuinely enormous number,
far beyond any n you'd ever compute with in practice.*/
